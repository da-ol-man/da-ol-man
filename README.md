- 👋 Hi, I’m @da-ol-man, I'm 49 years old and I have finally realised I am actually not too old or stupid to learn the thing I've always wanted to know - How to design, build and run websites. It's amazing how much we can self sabotage! So here I am, so deep in it I feel completely overwhelmed and nervous, but most importantly excited! Excited because I am sure that if I just keep going, I will eventually get my head above water and be able to swim. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning HTML, CSS and Javascript and a couple of other goodies so that I can work with the jamstack. I do not know very much but as I have discovered static sites and web apps I have fallen in love with the speed and agility of these. I am sure that statement sounds naive to experienced developers, but it is just so great to go on a site that looks clean and fresh and is LIGHTNING fast. So I want to learn how to do my own! I'll be a happy man when that day arrives. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript but have just started. I have done some HTMl & CSS, but still need LOADS of practice (ouch, pains me how much). 
- 💞️ This is no doubt a stretch because I know everyone is SUPER busy, but if anyone is willing to be a mentor to an old man, I would be forever grateful. I am a super good student/apprentice in the sense that I love learn, take notes so you don't have to repeat yourself (my brain is already getting old so it's needed) and I am not rude or cheeky. I am also super flexible and open minded. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... I suppose by email is best for those of you out there, but I love talking on the phone. Whatever floats your boat is good with me. my details are: forces4free@yahoo.com or waynehattingh@mail.com, or +48 579 980 500.
Thanks for reading my README! Take it easy!
